 *
 * Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in
 * the tree.
 *
 * According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely
 * filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far
 * left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2^h nodes inclusive at the last
 * level h.
 *
 * Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
 * Output: 6
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = []
 * Output: 0
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [1]
 * Output: 1
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4].
 * 0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 10^4
 * The tree is guaranteed to be complete.
